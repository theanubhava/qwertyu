Best Selling Price

You need to make a program in which



1.) You can add a product -> addProduct(“p1”)
2.) A user can purchase a product -> purchase(“u1″,”p1”)
3.) A user can return a product -> returnProduct(“u1″,”p1”)
4.) A user can be blacklisted and all of his purchases will be marked null -> blackListUser(“u1”)
5.) Display the best selling product -> bestSelling()
Best selling product will be the one which have been bought by most number of unique users.

Bonus: Display the best selling products for each category.

Evaluation: After you are done with your code, two Flipkart SDEs will run test cases on your code and evaluate it. They will also ask some questions around your code.
